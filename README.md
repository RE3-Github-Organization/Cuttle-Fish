> A dark, slick, modern, responsive, adjective-drenched design built around an extremely dynamic landing page (scroll that mofo!). Inspired by Big Picture, another design of mine with a similarish feel/flow, only this time I took it waaaaaay further and actually made it multipurpose (versus copping out and making it a one pager like I did last time ;) Includes multiple pages, a bunch of pre-styled elements, and all its Sass sources.
